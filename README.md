# Assign__6_DM_Anti-Cancer_Drug_Activity_Prediction

This competition is a bioassay task for anticancer activity prediction, where each chemical compound is represented as a graph, with atoms representing nodes and bonds as edges. A chemical compound is positive against non-small cell lung cancer, or negative otherwise. Up to this point, you have learned various tricks and mechanisms to be used for building neural networks/tuning models.
